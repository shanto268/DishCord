# DishCord üìçüçΩÔ∏èü§ñ: Discord Bot with Recipes from Pinterest Board

My girlfriend woke up today with the idea of being able to search for recipes based on ingredients from her [food Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/madihowa/foods/). Four hours later, she got this bot that does just that.

## Features

1. **Pinterest Recipe Integration**

   - Fetch recipes directly from Pinterest boards.
   - Scrape titles, images, and ingredients from recipe sites.
   - Store recipes in a structured JSON format.

2. **Intelligent Ingredient Parsing**

   - Use local LLMs to interpret natural language ingredient queries (e.g., `"What can I make with shrimp and garlic?"`).
   - Includes **fuzzy search logic** to match similar or related ingredients, ensuring flexibility (e.g., `"red pepper flakes"` matches `"pepper flakes"` or `"ground pepper"`).

3. **Discord Bot Commands**

   - `!recipe <query>`: Find recipes matching your ingredients.
   - Auto-DM rules to new users.
   - `!gpt <query>`: For some general chat with the local LLM.
